she sp@@ read h@@ on@@ ey th@@ i@@ ck@@ ly on her to@@ a@@ st .
do you sp@@ end more time with your friends or with your family ?

did you keep in t@@ ou@@ ch ?
have you already made friends with her ?
why did you leave the light on in the me@@ eting room ?
Tom wanted to ask Mary about how John died .
Tom knows what &apos;s good .
if an English spea@@ ker says some@@ one is j@@ ol@@ ly , that me@@ ans they are che@@ er@@ ful or fri@@ end@@ ly . but in French , j@@ ol@@ ie me@@ ans some@@ one is good @-@ looking or ple@@ as@@ ant to look at . in any c@@ ase , both are ni@@ ce things to say to some@@ one .

hi@@ gh@@ er ta@@ x@@ es hur@@ t the e@@ con@@ om@@ y .
look at me when you &apos;re talking to me .

Tom looked again .
G@@ o@@ d doesn &apos;t make mista@@ kes .

Tom always bra@@ gs about how rich he is .
Mary is easy @-@ going and fu@@ n .

I had my wal@@ let st@@ ol@@ en on the b@@ us .
Tom has some food all@@ er@@ gi@@ es , so he has to be car@@ e@@ ful about what he ea@@ ts .
this man is ali@@ ve .
Mary said she thought Tom wasn &apos;t fin@@ is@@ hed doing that yet .
Tom seems to like teach@@ ing French .
C@@ ul@@ tur@@ es of the E@@ a@@ st and the We@@ st are mi@@ x@@ ed in this country .
Tom pu@@ ll@@ ed out his i@@ P@@ h@@ one .

Tom lo@@ ves ch@@ o@@ col@@ ate ca@@ ke .

Tom is one of Mary &apos;s bro@@ thers .
Tom is going to th@@ ank me .
no other c@@ as@@ u@@ al@@ ti@@ es have been re@@ por@@ ted .
I need a new b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle .
Tom and Mary each took a si@@ p of w@@ ine .
we have to think about this a little lon@@ ger .
Tom w@@ ro@@ te a letter to S@@ an@@ t@@ a .
she married him last year .
Tom left home at 2 : 30 .
the j@@ u@@ d@@ ge said he had never seen such an a@@ mi@@ c@@ able and mu@@ tu@@ ally a@@ gre@@ ed di@@ vor@@ ce .
she sel@@ e@@ cted a hat to ma@@ tch her new dress .
what was your mo@@ tive ?
we or@@ der@@ ed too much food .
your co@@ at is very beautiful .
I can &apos;t see anything in here .
Tom t@@ rea@@ ts me like a pr@@ in@@ c@@ ess .
the English l@@ es@@ son started at 8 : 30 .
Tom is a friend .
I did not be@@ tra@@ y you .
you should know that .
I knew you &apos;d like it .

Tom &apos;s s@@ ou@@ p ta@@ sted sur@@ pri@@ sin@@ g@@ ly good .

I had something else in mind .
Tom and Mary bought a hand@@ made ru@@ g .
who tal@@ ked ?
how do you like my new su@@ it ?
he spea@@ ks only English and Ger@@ man , n@@ ei@@ ther of which I understand .
would you be so kind as to l@@ end me your book ?
it was so ni@@ ce to me@@ et you .
a t@@ oo@@ th can be re@@ pla@@ ced with an im@@ plan@@ t .
she lives in an ap@@ ar@@ t@@ ment alone .
this can &apos;t be a rea@@ l di@@ a@@ mon@@ d .
his ex@@ plan@@ ation doesn &apos;t make sen@@ se at all .
the s@@ hi@@ p is un@@ sel@@ la@@ ble .
Tom is in a good m@@ ood .
I cannot go down the sta@@ ir@@ s . both my le@@ gs are bro@@ ken .
Tom bo@@ il@@ ed the p@@ ot@@ a@@ to@@ es .
Tom sta@@ yed up late into the night wor@@ king on his spe@@ e@@ ch .
Tom isn &apos;t able to do his job any@@ more .
clo@@ th@@ es make the man .
Tom wasn &apos;t expe@@ c@@ ting vi@@ si@@ t@@ or@@ s .
ear@@ th is per@@ fe@@ c@@ tly su@@ ited for life .
why were you late ?

Tom , what &apos;s wrong with you t@@ on@@ i@@ ght ?
a@@ im . fi@@ re !
I wasn &apos;t expe@@ c@@ ting you so soon .
Tom met Mary at a party .
and then he s@@ at down himself .

by a@@ ir ma@@ il , please .
the picture on the w@@ all was pa@@ in@@ ted by P@@ ic@@ as@@ so .

we ex@@ ch@@ ange@@ d gre@@ et@@ in@@ gs .
let us tur@@ n now to the f@@ un@@ da@@ men@@ ta@@ l is@@ su@@ e .
I think Tom &apos;s gran@@ d@@ mother is too old to w@@ ear a min@@ is@@ k@@ ir@@ t .
Tom bu@@ il@@ t a bir@@ d@@ house .
you should eat this while it &apos;s still war@@ m .
the door was lo@@ cked on the in@@ side .
Tom and I are about the same hei@@ ght .
col@@ le@@ ge gra@@ du@@ at@@ es ear@@ n on a@@ ver@@ age over fi@@ f@@ ty p@@ er cent more than those with only a hi@@ gh @-@ school de@@ g@@ ree .
the ra@@ di@@ o is too l@@ ou@@ d .
she is no or@@ d@@ in@@ ary stu@@ dent .
please cor@@ re@@ ct my mista@@ kes .
this is a to@@ wer .
have you ever heard of something si@@ mi@@ lar ?
Tom isn &apos;t anything like his brother .
I don &apos;t think I s@@ nor@@ e .
it &apos;s si@@ x o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck already .
I w@@ ro@@ te my th@@ es@@ is about that .
I &apos;ll do my best to get it for you , but I don &apos;t prom@@ ise anything .
the beg@@ inn@@ ing of the tr@@ ou@@ ble was his car@@ el@@ ess re@@ mar@@ k .
some@@ body &apos;s kno@@ ck@@ ing at your door .
I love to see you s@@ mi@@ le .
I wouldn &apos;t re@@ comm@@ end it .
Tom looked at me like I was cra@@ z@@ y .
you &apos;d better get up early .
take a b@@ us .
my Chin@@ ese isn &apos;t very good .
they want to learn English .
you &apos;re a problem .
she can ask questi@@ ons and answer them .
we a@@ im at that ob@@ je@@ c@@ tive .
you &apos;ve ear@@ ned it .
my gran@@ d@@ father tur@@ ned 8@@ 9 years old .
she married her hi@@ gh school s@@ wee@@ th@@ ear@@ t .
can you make an exc@@ ep@@ tion ?
there was no one at all in the wh@@ ole house .
we have three a@@ ir@@ plan@@ es .
what are you doing down there ?
you could &apos;ve wal@@ ked away .
I &apos;ll be here all morning if anyone nee@@ ds me .
f@@ our per@@ cent in@@ f@@ la@@ tion is fo@@ re@@ ca@@ st for this year .

S@@ am@@ i gi@@ g@@ gl@@ ed .
this s@@ ci@@ ence @-@ fi@@ ction no@@ v@@ el is very intere@@ st@@ ing .
he con@@ si@@ der@@ s himself a gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an of mor@@ al st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds .
why do you feel that way ?
K@@ o@@ be is the c@@ ity which I was bor@@ n in .
Tom never wo@@ ke up .
Tom said that Mary was will@@ ing to help us do that .
I ste@@ pp@@ ed on a p@@ ie@@ ce of bro@@ ken gl@@ ass .
Tom said that he wanted to mo@@ ve to Boston .
for on@@ ce in your life , you &apos;re ex@@ ac@@ tly right .
she likes these ca@@ ts .
if I &apos;m sel@@ l@@ ing to you , I speak your language . if I &apos;m bu@@ ying , then you have to speak Ger@@ man .
I just lost at the ra@@ ces so I &apos;m fl@@ at bro@@ ke .
there is no li@@ mit to h@@ u@@ man pro@@ gre@@ ss .
where is the y@@ el@@ low j@@ ug of mil@@ k ?
she &apos;s your dau@@ gh@@ ter , too .
Tom can b@@ end spo@@ ons with the po@@ wer of his mind .
Tom knows what &apos;s best for us .
how is it in a pri@@ v@@ ate school ?
put the gar@@ ba@@ ge ou@@ t@@ side .
I can &apos;t live without a T@@ V .
you should have pre@@ par@@ ed for the l@@ es@@ son .
she was ab@@ sent on the gro@@ und of ill@@ n@@ ess .
the water in this v@@ il@@ la@@ ge is con@@ ta@@ min@@ a@@ ted by ar@@ sen@@ ic .
that is no good .
he lost everything he o@@ w@@ ned .
they all con@@ gra@@ tu@@ la@@ ted him .
I for@@ got to at@@ ta@@ ch a sta@@ m@@ p to the en@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ e .
come on . let &apos;s get out of here .

Tom k@@ ept fo@@ c@@ used .
a co@@ ke , please .
everyone was sa@@ ti@@ s@@ fi@@ ed .
can you come at n@@ ine ?
I wish you &apos;d never told me .
Tom was k@@ illed with a s@@ word .
Tom was too exc@@ ited to sle@@ ep .
Tom is a vi@@ de@@ o ga@@ me de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ er .
she ca@@ ck@@ l@@ ed at the po@@ or man . &quot; so it is that you have one wish left . &quot;
are you here on ho@@ li@@ day ?
Tom isn &apos;t as t@@ all as his father yet .
the w@@ ha@@ le is a ma@@ m@@ mal .
it &apos;s been a long time since we &apos;ve had such ni@@ ce wea@@ ther .
what go@@ es on in this room ?
n@@ one of the me@@ at was f@@ it to eat .
Tom and Mary said John wasn &apos;t at home when they went to v@@ is@@ it him .
if these mus@@ c@@ les are wea@@ k , they cannot h@@ old the k@@ nee@@ ca@@ p in the cor@@ re@@ ct pos@@ i@@ tion .
when Tom is at home , he doesn &apos;t want to talk about work .
I thought you mi@@ ght &apos;ve left to@@ wn .
I &apos;ll be@@ t Tom will know what to do .
they &apos;ll stop at nothing to ach@@ ie@@ ve their poli@@ ti@@ cal go@@ als .
the ea@@ g@@ le does not ca@@ tch f@@ li@@ es .
Tom already in@@ t@@ ends to leave early .
why don &apos;t you give it an@@ other try ?
how long do you want to stay here ?
it doesn &apos;t matter at all to me .
Tom must be ne@@ ar@@ ly thir@@ ty .

that &apos;s a problem .
I &apos;m just going to answer the call of na@@ ture .
he ought to have arrived in Ne@@ w Y@@ or@@ k about this time .
Tom likes S@@ wi@@ ss che@@ ese .
a di@@ a@@ g@@ on@@ al ma@@ tri@@ x is pos@@ i@@ tive se@@ mi@@ de@@ fin@@ ite if and only if all of its el@@ em@@ ents are n@@ on@@ ne@@ ga@@ tive .

I didn &apos;t like be@@ er at that time .
please don &apos;t s@@ mo@@ ke .
Tom com@@ es here every day .

I &apos;ve been in Boston since O@@ c@@ to@@ ber .

Li@@ ons are str@@ on@@ ger than w@@ ol@@ ves .
I wish my dre@@ am would come true .
I can &apos;t ig@@ nor@@ e that .
he won the first pri@@ ze at the ch@@ ess t@@ our@@ na@@ ment .
I could write Tom a no@@ te if you want me to .
Tom is di@@ eting .
many s@@ ci@@ enti@@ st@@ s knew him .
you must not re@@ ly too much on app@@ ear@@ an@@ ce .
give her some flo@@ wer@@ s in re@@ tur@@ n for her k@@ in@@ d@@ n@@ ess .
I &apos;ll get my ke@@ ys .
he has more boo@@ ks than I do .
this fi@@ g@@ ure is supp@@ os@@ ed to re@@ pre@@ sent Mar@@ il@@ y@@ n Mon@@ ro@@ e , but I don &apos;t think it does her j@@ u@@ sti@@ ce .

do you want to see Tom again ?
Tom said he wasn &apos;t intere@@ sted in Mary , but he seem@@ ed to always be looking to@@ war@@ ds the side of the room where she was .
I think Tom is je@@ al@@ ous .
I can &apos;t believe that a gu@@ y like Tom was married to a woman as beautiful as Mary .
Tom remem@@ ber@@ ed everything .
he &apos;s not pa@@ ying any at@@ ten@@ tion to me .
are you here today for any par@@ ti@@ cu@@ lar reas@@ on ?
it &apos;s ob@@ vi@@ ous that you &apos;re wrong .
don &apos;t call Tom that .
Tom has his hear@@ t in the right pla@@ ce .

you &apos;d better let me do that for you .
we must con@@ for@@ m to the ru@@ les .

their op@@ in@@ i@@ ons diff@@ er from m@@ ine .

the col@@ our@@ s of her dress and sho@@ es go well together .
he got re@@ la@@ ted with her through mar@@ ri@@ age .
s@@ har@@ p &apos;s the word !
Tom called Mary up from the a@@ ir@@ p@@ ort .

Tom has no des@@ i@@ re to go to the mo@@ vi@@ es .
I met some@@ body on@@ l@@ ine .

I had nothing better to do .
we &apos;re all here exc@@ ept for him .
I was the one who t@@ au@@ ght Tom to read .
it is im@@ por@@ t@@ ant to understand that each country has its own c@@ ul@@ ture .

I &apos;ve never been ro@@ b@@ bed .
Tom d@@ yed his hair bro@@ wn .
su@@ d@@ den@@ ly he saw me .
my time is ex@@ pen@@ si@@ ve because time is the most pre@@ ci@@ ous thing we have . but for lear@@ ning langu@@ a@@ ges , I always have the time . because with each new word we learn , our world be@@ com@@ es a ta@@ d more intere@@ st@@ ing .
the at@@ m@@ os@@ p@@ here pro@@ te@@ c@@ ts us from me@@ te@@ or@@ s .

&quot; have you ever thought of k@@ ill@@ ing yourself ? &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m not a person who would end their own life . &quot;
there are many beautiful par@@ ks in Boston .
you don &apos;t like me , do you ?
do you think anyone can see me ?
I think Tom should stay .
we heard Tom come do@@ w@@ n@@ sta@@ ir@@ s .

Tom is c@@ le@@ ver and re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ e@@ ful .
the ga@@ m@@ b@@ ler lost a good de@@ al of money .

she is af@@ ra@@ id of ca@@ ts .

I think that &apos;s an intere@@ st@@ ing pro@@ f@@ es@@ sion .
I want fre@@ e@@ d@@ om .
I am as@@ ha@@ med of my@@ self for my po@@ or English .
Tom didn &apos;t no@@ ti@@ ce me .
all of the to@@ ys are w@@ oo@@ den .
Mary is a fin@@ e @-@ looking woman .
why are you looking at me like that ?
he has no wi@@ fe , no children and no friends .
I &apos;d ra@@ ther walk than wa@@ it for a b@@ us .
you will have to ap@@ olo@@ gi@@ ze when you see him .
it is qu@@ ite na@@ tu@@ ra@@ l for her to get an@@ gry .
Tom is a few in@@ ches sh@@ or@@ ter than Mary .
he r@@ an ac@@ ros@@ s the stre@@ et , lea@@ ving her alone .
Mary just got her hair done .
V@@ ol@@ can@@ o@@ es can be ac@@ tive , d@@ or@@ m@@ ant , or ex@@ t@@ in@@ ct .
Tom told me Mary wanted to see me .
the stu@@ dent coun@@ ci@@ l dis@@ c@@ us@@ sed plan@@ s for the gra@@ du@@ ation .
I am as I am , but I am not always what I want to be .
I &apos;ll take this one .
this lost him his life .
st@@ ran@@ ge .
please don &apos;t take pic@@ tur@@ es here .
I want to buy a new b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle .
Tom said that he could swi@@ m well .
the fi@@ re was cra@@ ck@@ l@@ ing che@@ er@@ i@@ ly .
it &apos;ll get war@@ m@@ er soon .
Tom and his teacher were talking to each other .
I told him how pr@@ ou@@ d I was of him .
I think each of us should give Tom something for his bir@@ th@@ day , something home @-@ made !
the m@@ om@@ ent he saw me he r@@ an away .
Tom tal@@ ked with his friends yesterday .
Mary bu@@ ried her face in her han@@ ds and so@@ b@@ bed un@@ con@@ tr@@ ol@@ la@@ b@@ ly .

I was l@@ ying .
I don &apos;t en@@ jo@@ y so@@ li@@ tu@@ de .
we want you to feel wel@@ come .

Tom bought a ne@@ w@@ sp@@ aper .
can I call you B@@ ob ?
let &apos;s me@@ et tomorrow at the same pla@@ ce we did last week .

Tom took off his hat .
Tom took the s@@ c@@ is@@ sor@@ s away from Mary .
I &apos;m not even sure who he is .
she bought chi@@ cken .
we sle@@ p@@ t in a very sm@@ all t@@ ent .
I really wasn &apos;t expe@@ c@@ ting that from you .
everything he says is cor@@ re@@ ct .
he could not re@@ s@@ ist the te@@ mp@@ ta@@ tion .
why didn &apos;t you come ear@@ li@@ er ?
gen@@ er@@ ally spea@@ king , Japanese wom@@ en are mo@@ dest .
you need to be pre@@ t@@ ty f@@ it to ru@@ n up si@@ x f@@ li@@ gh@@ ts of sta@@ ir@@ s .
that looks so exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ at@@ in@@ g@@ ly bor@@ ing .
I didn &apos;t re@@ ali@@ ze it was so late .
my sister lives ne@@ ar Y@@ o@@ ko@@ ha@@ m@@ a .
she &apos;ll be ap@@ pl@@ es .

o@@ ka@@ y , Tom , you can open your ey@@ es now !
you don &apos;t ac@@ c@@ ept gi@@ f@@ ts .
nobody &apos;s here yet .
why are you in such a bad m@@ ood today ?

come home at si@@ x .
as soon as I can get a de@@ cent vi@@ de@@ o ca@@ mer@@ a , I &apos;ll star@@ t ma@@ king vi@@ de@@ o@@ s to put on@@ l@@ ine .
Mary doesn &apos;t like par@@ sle@@ y .
these fa@@ c@@ ts ad@@ mit of no con@@ tra@@ di@@ ction .
you can think of the re@@ st yourself .
first , let &apos;s talk about what Tom did .
why isn &apos;t Tom doing that ?
a lar@@ ge c@@ ro@@ w@@ d had ga@@ th@@ er@@ ed on the stre@@ et .
Mary could tell by the way Tom s@@ la@@ mm@@ ed the door that he wasn &apos;t happy .
Tom now we@@ ars a wi@@ g .
she sin@@ gs in the ch@@ o@@ ir .
S@@ om@@ eh@@ o@@ w , Tom knew .
is K@@ im J@@ ong i@@ ll or is K@@ im J@@ ong o@@ ka@@ y ?
my off@@ ice is in my ap@@ ar@@ t@@ ment .
there &apos;s a lot we don &apos;t know .
I think Tom can help .
he asked for some money .
does Tom know about it ?
he o@@ w@@ n@@ s a lot of land .
Tom wanted to poli@@ sh his sho@@ es .
he made his will last year .
on this side of the mo@@ un@@ ta@@ in , it doesn &apos;t rain much .
do you have R@@ us@@ si@@ an ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers ?
the pri@@ son@@ ers fl@@ ed from the con@@ c@@ en@@ tra@@ tion ca@@ m@@ p .
she &apos;s lost a lot of wei@@ ght since she went on a di@@ et .
how long has she been si@@ ck ?
which do you like better , sk@@ at@@ ing or s@@ ki@@ ing ?
P@@ at@@ ri@@ c@@ ia ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ ed the house .
Tom is a hi@@ ll@@ b@@ il@@ ly .
I need some b@@ lu@@ e pa@@ int .
Tom doesn &apos;t have many friends in Boston .
th@@ ank you for brin@@ ging that up .
could you tur@@ n it down ?
I know you love Tom .
have you already met her ?
Tom si@@ g@@ ned the do@@ c@@ um@@ ents .
Tom ma@@ jo@@ red in che@@ mi@@ str@@ y .
you &apos;re ab@@ sol@@ u@@ tely right .
I &apos;ll be home by mi@@ d@@ night at the la@@ test .
my c@@ at wei@@ gh@@ s about ten po@@ un@@ ds .
just won@@ der@@ ing how you are doing .
in the old days , things were a lot si@@ mp@@ ler .
do you know how to use this ma@@ ch@@ ine ?
Tom s@@ at qui@@ et@@ ly star@@ ing at the fi@@ re .
give me something to write with .
the com@@ mit@@ te@@ e is made up of ten mem@@ ber@@ s .
the world beg@@ an without man and it sha@@ ll end without him .
I have made my deci@@ sion .
good af@@ ter@@ no@@ on .
she met him for brea@@ k@@ fast .
that would take too long .
every@@ body was ga@@ th@@ er@@ ed in the li@@ ving room .
what &apos;re you going to do about these co@@ ck@@ ro@@ ach@@ es ?
it &apos;s not comp@@ li@@ ca@@ ted .
did you just me@@ et her ?
most people think so .
s@@ it down on the ben@@ ch .
this lar@@ ge so@@ f@@ a would be out of pla@@ ce in a sm@@ all room .
tell me more .
year 20@@ 1@@ 1 &apos;s most no@@ t@@ or@@ i@@ ous ex@@ pre@@ s@@ sion is &quot; K@@ e@@ ba@@ b m@@ ur@@ der@@ s . &quot;
Tom wants to fin@@ ish doing what he &apos;s doing before he go@@ es home .
everyone thin@@ ks the same thing .
the more time I sp@@ end doing this , the less time I have to do things I en@@ jo@@ y doing .
Tom had to live with the con@@ se@@ qu@@ en@@ ces of his ac@@ tions .
wa@@ it un@@ ti@@ l tomorrow morning .
don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re tired already .
de@@ ar me , what pre@@ t@@ ty dan@@ c@@ ing @-@ sho@@ es !
you look good in that su@@ it .
so you tal@@ ked to Mary ?
you tried to stop Tom from doing that , didn &apos;t you ?
where are they going to go ?
Tom wants to learn some French son@@ gs .
don &apos;t do anything you &apos;ll re@@ gre@@ t .
p@@ aper ca@@ t@@ ches fi@@ re eas@@ i@@ ly .
how did you get to know that person ?
which sh@@ el@@ f do you want me to put it on ?
Tom , be reas@@ on@@ able .
the good woman is ma@@ king a s@@ ou@@ p .
here &apos;s my tel@@ ep@@ h@@ one n@@ um@@ ber .
I met Na@@ om@@ i on my way home and we had a ch@@ at .
today I have an E@@ sp@@ er@@ an@@ to c@@ lass .
do you have a qu@@ ie@@ t pla@@ ce where you can do your hom@@ e@@ work ?
I don &apos;t like to talk about my@@ self .
they saw a st@@ ran@@ ge ani@@ mal there .
please get these p@@ ap@@ ers out of the way .
they have a very good c@@ ur@@ ri@@ c@@ ul@@ um at that uni@@ ver@@ si@@ ty .
I think it is mor@@ ally wrong to eat people .
I prom@@ ise to call .
do you like por@@ k lo@@ in ?
we have to use the sta@@ ir@@ s because the ele@@ v@@ at@@ or is out of or@@ der .
you &apos;re never sa@@ ti@@ s@@ fi@@ ed .
Tom and I had a long con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion while we were waiting for Mary .
I don &apos;t want Tom to hear about this .
I didn &apos;t even get an in@@ v@@ it@@ ation .
th@@ us I have heard .
a so@@ ci@@ et@@ y without re@@ li@@ gi@@ on is like a s@@ hi@@ p without a comp@@ ass .
Tom is ble@@ e@@ ding .
how much in@@ t@@ ol@@ er@@ an@@ ce are we pre@@ par@@ ed to t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate ?
I wish I &apos;d had more time to pre@@ p@@ are .
don &apos;t make prom@@ is@@ es you can &apos;t keep .
the house where we sp@@ ent our first days is un@@ for@@ ge@@ tt@@ able . it is the best and most lo@@ ved one . that is where my yo@@ un@@ ge@@ st sister lear@@ ned to walk in D@@ e@@ c@@ em@@ ber . even the sm@@ al@@ le@@ st cor@@ n@@ ers of every room e@@ vo@@ ke s@@ we@@ et mem@@ or@@ i@@ es .
the hou@@ se@@ bo@@ at is in the bo@@ a@@ th@@ ou@@ se .
she didn &apos;t ex@@ p@@ ose her sk@@ in to the su@@ n .
that &apos;s not what you said before .
they did away with the old sy@@ st@@ em .
his mother died when he was young , and his gran@@ d@@ mother br@@ ought him up .
P@@ au@@ l@@ a was called away on ur@@ g@@ ent bus@@ in@@ ess .
you must on no ac@@ coun@@ t do such a thing .
she spea@@ ks H@@ eb@@ re@@ w with her mother and Poli@@ sh with her father .
are you being bit@@ ten by m@@ os@@ qu@@ it@@ o@@ es ?
Tom and I &apos;ve been friends for years .
that &apos;s not very r@@ om@@ an@@ ti@@ c .
long live the E@@ m@@ per@@ or !
ke@@ ep@@ ing a h@@ or@@ se is a big re@@ sp@@ on@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ty .
she was ea@@ ting a s@@ and@@ w@@ ich .
Tom is s@@ li@@ gh@@ tly under the wea@@ ther today .

N@@ ep@@ tun@@ e has win@@ ds in its at@@ m@@ os@@ p@@ here which b@@ low at over 20@@ 00 k@@ il@@ om@@ et@@ ers p@@ er h@@ our !
Tom har@@ d@@ ly ever ac@@ ts his age .
what is it that you want me to do now ?
when he saw that there was nothing more to see , he took his bi@@ ke and ro@@ de home .
how is this pos@@ sible ?
Mary gave Tom all the money she had on her .
she lives with her parents .
the che@@ mi@@ cal sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l H ex@@ pre@@ ss@@ es h@@ y@@ d@@ ro@@ gen .
does this sent@@ ence make sen@@ se ?

can you ex@@ pla@@ in why ?
her friend is a sin@@ ger .
how did you know what she wanted ?

how are you ?
Tom has a big n@@ ose .
there &apos;s a big party at his pla@@ ce .

who asked you to help ?
Tom beg@@ an to like Mary more and more .
wa@@ it , you gu@@ ys .

Tom usu@@ ally only we@@ ars his gl@@ as@@ s@@ es when he &apos;s reading .
she left her son a lot of money .
Tom went out .
hard work en@@ ab@@ l@@ ed him to get good mar@@ ks .
I wish you were here .
by the time you get out of pri@@ son , she &apos;ll be married .
since Tom &apos;s Ta@@ ver@@ n has started off@@ er@@ ing a d@@ el@@ i@@ very ser@@ vi@@ ce too , it has been f@@ loo@@ ded with ph@@ one call@@ s .
you took it out of the o@@ ven too soon .
Tom has ap@@ olo@@ gi@@ z@@ ed for his comm@@ ents .
this woman is not from S@@ y@@ ri@@ a .
it &apos;s bad for bus@@ in@@ ess .
Tom went di@@ rec@@ tly to his room as soon as he got home .
does that me@@ an something ?
he gave his life for his country .
&quot; did you ki@@ ll Mary ? &quot; &quot; no , I did not . &quot;
make a pre@@ di@@ ction .
D@@ ol@@ p@@ hin@@ s are so@@ ci@@ al an@@ im@@ als .
did that un@@ cle of his often v@@ is@@ it Amer@@ ic@@ a ?
I couldn &apos;t put up with that no@@ ise any lon@@ ger .
never mind Tom .

I tried to for@@ ce my@@ self to stay a@@ wa@@ ke .
do you know anyone who &apos;s g@@ one to Boston ?
Tom is ob@@ s@@ es@@ sed with An@@ ci@@ ent E@@ g@@ y@@ p@@ t .
Tom bought a new c@@ ase for his sa@@ x@@ op@@ h@@ one .
I am in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ing money into this v@@ ent@@ ure .

I &apos;m si@@ ck of ea@@ ting f@@ ish .

I gave my word to Tom that I wouldn &apos;t do that .
Tom and Mary are almost fin@@ is@@ hed doing that .

you ha@@ ven &apos;t heard the hal@@ f of it yet .
he &apos;s an early bir@@ d .
he &apos;s cra@@ z@@ y about me .
as far as the ey@@ e could see , nothing could be seen exc@@ ept cor@@ n@@ fi@@ el@@ ds .
did Tom say anything before he died ?
Tom e@@ ven@@ tu@@ ally deci@@ ded to do that .
it &apos;s a war cri@@ me .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done what you say he did .
I like com@@ ic boo@@ ks .
Tom se@@ ar@@ ch@@ ed his mem@@ or@@ y .
everything will tur@@ n out fin@@ e .
the Ber@@ l@@ in w@@ all was bu@@ il@@ t to pre@@ v@@ ent E@@ a@@ st Ger@@ m@@ ans from f@@ le@@ eing to the We@@ st .

she has an ex@@ tra@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ary ab@@ i@@ li@@ ty in musi@@ c .

he &apos;s already a man .
she gre@@ et@@ ed me poli@@ tely .
&quot; what was that ? &quot; &quot; nothing . &quot;
the f@@ ish was not fre@@ sh .

I met your parents yesterday .
this matter is of great im@@ por@@ t@@ an@@ ce .
I think Tom would di@@ sag@@ ree .
you are com@@ ple@@ tely right .
that is why I was late for c@@ lass yesterday .
this p@@ ho@@ to is too bl@@ ur@@ ry . I can &apos;t make out your face .
some@@ day the new re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch work will be com@@ ple@@ ted .
Tom will get over it .
Tom ho@@ p@@ es that he can v@@ is@@ it Boston before he di@@ es .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re sle@@ ep@@ y .

I ba@@ ked him some bro@@ w@@ ni@@ es .
E@@ met s@@ at at my be@@ d@@ side for ten hou@@ rs .

I think Tom and Mary are thir@@ st@@ y .

why aren &apos;t we doing that ?
c@@ li@@ ck on &quot; sa@@ ve &quot; to beg@@ in the do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad .
I never lear@@ ned how to write .
Mary told Tom she wanted John to te@@ ach him how to do that .
very si@@ mp@@ le was my ex@@ plan@@ ation , and p@@ lau@@ sible enough - as most wrong the@@ or@@ i@@ es are !
they con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ed the ex@@ per@@ im@@ ent day and night .

I wish I could help you .
Mary told Tom that she thought John was de@@ p@@ end@@ able .
I had a hea@@ da@@ che .

Tom spea@@ ks exc@@ ell@@ ent French , but his English isn &apos;t very good .
I was wo@@ un@@ ded by her comm@@ ents .

Tom ra@@ is@@ ed his gl@@ ass and said , &quot; T@@ o the happy c@@ ou@@ p@@ le ! &quot;

why didn &apos;t you try the dress on before you bought it ?
any@@ body is better than nobody .
O@@ K , I &apos;ll or@@ der it .

he has cor@@ por@@ al &apos;s stri@@ p@@ es .
a man who la@@ ck@@ s re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ e@@ fu@@ l@@ n@@ ess is us@@ el@@ ess .
Tom wasn &apos;t able to change Mary &apos;s mind .
the day is sh@@ ort and there &apos;s a lot of work .
Tom got here on time .
I can &apos;t stand this kind of mo@@ v@@ ie .
where do I get off ?
G@@ or@@ ill@@ as cannot use their li@@ ps and t@@ on@@ gu@@ es to speak , but they can comm@@ uni@@ ca@@ te with people in other ways .
do you think French is diff@@ ic@@ u@@ lt ?
how d@@ are you talk about Tom like that !
Un@@ for@@ tun@@ at@@ ely , an er@@ ro@@ r has o@@ cc@@ ur@@ red .
Mary told Tom that she thought John was hun@@ gry .

Tom thought about what Mary had said .
Tom and Mary told John that they were ready to leave .
I can not understand the p@@ sy@@ ch@@ olo@@ g@@ y of ad@@ ol@@ es@@ c@@ ents .
all gro@@ wn @-@ up@@ s were on@@ ce children .
do you think Tom saw it ?
Tom can swi@@ m no more than a st@@ one can .
I &apos;m fin@@ is@@ h@@ ing my hom@@ e@@ work .
you should school yourself to be pa@@ ti@@ ent .
the stor@@ e was re@@ la@@ ti@@ v@@ ely em@@ p@@ ty .
why should I pa@@ y ?
how can some@@ one who knows the language so well have such a th@@ i@@ ck ac@@ cent ?
kno@@ w@@ ing a to@@ pi@@ c is one thing , but teach@@ ing it is a wh@@ ole no@@ ther story .

wh@@ ose house is ac@@ ros@@ s from your@@ s ?

Japanese people are for@@ tun@@ ate to live in a land with na@@ tu@@ ra@@ l ho@@ t sp@@ rin@@ gs .
Mary was off@@ en@@ ded when Tom bought her some brea@@ th fre@@ sh@@ en@@ er .

my father bought me a wat@@ ch , which I don &apos;t like very much .
we &apos;re con@@ fi@@ dent that you are up to the ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge of the new pos@@ i@@ tion .
the ga@@ p be@@ t@@ we@@ en what can be i@@ ma@@ gin@@ ed and what can be ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ed has never been sm@@ all@@ er .

Tom wasn &apos;t able to work last week .
this pa@@ ck@@ a@@ ging is hard to re@@ mo@@ ve .

I want you to look for Tom .
this is the house where that po@@ et li@@ ved when he was a chi@@ ld .

I don &apos;t know anyone who cor@@ re@@ sp@@ on@@ ds to that des@@ cri@@ p@@ tion .
it &apos;s no use wor@@ r@@ ying about it . there &apos;s nothing you can do .
je@@ al@@ ous@@ y is the und@@ u@@ e con@@ c@@ ern about the pre@@ ser@@ v@@ ation of that which can only be lost if not wor@@ th ke@@ ep@@ ing .
E@@ th@@ ic@@ s is a br@@ an@@ ch of p@@ hi@@ los@@ op@@ h@@ y .

Tom is in the pri@@ me of his life .
I want to know why you &apos;re doing this .

did I for@@ get to men@@ tion that ?
we can &apos;t let Tom have that di@@ a@@ mon@@ d .

I gu@@ ess you &apos;ve been to Boston before .

why doesn &apos;t he tell me jo@@ kes any@@ more ?

if it were not for your ad@@ vi@@ ce , I would be at a los@@ s .
what I have to tell you is very im@@ por@@ t@@ ant .

he r@@ ar@@ ely went there .
I didn &apos;t sh@@ oo@@ t anyone .
you won &apos;t believe what happened to me today .
Tom doesn &apos;t know French .
Tom cra@@ w@@ l@@ ed out from under the table .

the man was@@ h@@ ing the car is M@@ r@@ . J@@ on@@ es .
Tom has been to Boston a n@@ um@@ ber of times .
Austr@@ al@@ ia is the lar@@ ge@@ st country in the world without bor@@ der@@ s with any other country .
I didn &apos;t understand anything , ei@@ ther .

what if we get c@@ au@@ ght ?
I can &apos;t ex@@ pla@@ in anything .
Tom took a picture of himself f@@ le@@ x@@ ing his ab@@ s in fr@@ on@@ t of the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r .
F@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ y is often the mother of ar@@ t .
the gar@@ den is really a si@@ ght for sor@@ e ey@@ es .
Tom didn &apos;t do much work today .
I like f@@ ish better than me@@ at .
Tom made no@@ ise .
it &apos;s really time something was done .
we often pla@@ yed house in the par@@ k .
have you ever tra@@ v@@ el@@ ed by a@@ ir ?

you &apos;ll be more com@@ for@@ table in this room .
Tom is lo@@ ving .
I ac@@ ted in ac@@ cor@@ dan@@ ce with my own con@@ vi@@ ction .
he need not give up the plan .
say it in Ger@@ man .
I &apos;m not used to this .
don &apos;t bo@@ a@@ st too much about that .
fre@@ sh @-@ water f@@ ish in@@ c@@ lu@@ de some des@@ ig@@ na@@ ted as pro@@ te@@ cted spe@@ ci@@ es . you &apos;re not al@@ low@@ ed to ca@@ tch or buy them .

the im@@ mi@@ gran@@ ts dre@@ am of ha@@ ving a new , better life .

the only reas@@ on Tom went to the party was that he expe@@ cted Mary to be there .
I &apos;m sure Tom and Mary don &apos;t want to be the on@@ es re@@ sp@@ on@@ sible for doing that .
why do you need to read such a book ?
Tom ! bring me a s@@ and@@ w@@ ich .
what is the pro@@ bab@@ i@@ li@@ ty that at lea@@ st two stu@@ den@@ ts have the same bir@@ th@@ day ?

I thought Tom was Mary &apos;s father .
even the most beautiful r@@ ose will some@@ day wi@@ lt .

I knew he was waiting for Mary .
I am di@@ vor@@ ced .
I wish you &apos;d stop doing that .

Tom left the room .
she k@@ illed time reading a ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine while she wait@@ ed .
have you ever tra@@ v@@ ell@@ ed by plan@@ e ?
Tom won@@ der@@ ed what Mary was so up@@ se@@ t about .

Tom pla@@ yed with his ki@@ ds .
we heard the e@@ ch@@ o of our vo@@ ic@@ es from the other side of the v@@ al@@ le@@ y .
I &apos;m the bad one .
she married John , not because she lo@@ ved him , but because he was a rich man .
then the K@@ ing said to his wi@@ fe , &quot; I@@ f the thir@@ te@@ en@@ th chi@@ ld which th@@ o@@ u ar@@ t about to bring into the world , is a girl , the t@@ wel@@ ve bo@@ ys sha@@ ll die , in or@@ der that her pos@@ s@@ es@@ si@@ ons may be great , and that the k@@ in@@ g@@ d@@ om may fall to her alone . &quot;

the hea@@ v@@ y rain pre@@ ven@@ ted me from going out .
I never wanted you to go .

why isn &apos;t the s@@ mo@@ ke going up the ch@@ im@@ ne@@ y like it &apos;s supp@@ os@@ ed to ?

A@@ o@@ i dan@@ ces well .

I ho@@ pe you don &apos;t take this the wrong way .
the bar@@ ten@@ der ki@@ cked Tom out of the bar .
