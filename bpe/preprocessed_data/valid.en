I made Tom go home .
the teacher em@@ p@@ ha@@ si@@ z@@ ed the im@@ por@@ t@@ an@@ ce of e@@ du@@ ca@@ tion .
it &apos;s hi@@ gh@@ ly un@@ li@@ k@@ ely that Tom will drink any be@@ er .

a lot of things happened today .
it was just a one @-@ night stand .
Tom has been in Boston for a week .

Tom wants to leave .

people are more e@@ du@@ ca@@ ted now than they used to be .
if you aren &apos;t there by 1@@ 0 : 00 , we &apos;ll leave without you .
I &apos;d better be going .
this fa@@ ir@@ y tal@@ e is easy enough for a se@@ ven @-@ year @-@ old chi@@ ld to read .
why did you need a ch@@ a@@ in@@ saw ?
